React Flux Seed
===============

A demo application demonstrating the Flux architecture and ReactJS
rendering.

Requirements
------------

1. `git`
2. `npm`

Setup
-----

1. `git clone https://github.com/prophittcorey/react-flux-seed`
2. `cd react-flux-seed`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`

The first step is to fetch the code with git and hopping into the repositories
root directory. Once inside, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. The
final step is running `gulp` to perform a development build and automatically
start a development server.

There are some additional `gulp` options you can provide for some added
functionality:

1. `gulp --livereload` will begin a development server with live reloading
   enabled.
2. `gulp --production` will begin a production build (minified/uglified)
